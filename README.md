# DreamerFramework

Framework designed to track and modify a rocket's launch. Uses two SP32, Raspberry Pi, and Processing. 
Designed in an internship with ConexaLab. The rocket was created as part of a social initiative called MAMUS which seeks to teach coding and robotics to underpriviledge kids in the city of Bucaramanga, Colombia. They elaborated the rocket which went on to compete at the second largest latin-american aerospacial competition in Brazil.
